## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything new because it was straigthforward, but it was an good oportunity to work more with Flexbox for the centering of the main card.

### Continued development

I still don't fully understand the "margin: auto;" propriety, I get by with trial and error for now, but I hope to get it right with practice.
